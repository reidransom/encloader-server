Goal
====

The goal of this project is create a web app that can easily be installed on a 
computer and allow (primarily) computers on the local network to use it to 
encode and upload videos for the web.

The main problem this project aims to fix is the situation where you have
multiple content producers needing to push video to the same place or places.
For example a post production company may have multiple Avid or Final Cut
editors posting video to the same website for review and approval.

This project should have similar functionality as Apple Compressor except that 
the user interface should be *much* simpler because the user should only see
presets which have been created by an "administrator".
